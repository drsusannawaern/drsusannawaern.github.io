<h1>Information for Young People</h1>

<p>
Have you ever met a psychologist before? Most people I meet haven't seen a
psychologist and they all have different ideas of what it is going to be like.
Some people may feel worried about coming and are angry with their parents for
making them come. Here are some common questions that people have asked me in
the past:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <blockquote>What does a psychologist do the first time you meet?</blockquote>

    <p>
    I will ask quite a few questions in order to understand what you need help
    with. I will ask what the problem is, when it started, how it started and how
    it is impacting on your life. I will also ask questions about your school and
    family and we will look at what you want to be different in your life. This
    information will help us decide what we need to do to deal with the problem and
    achieve your goals.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <blockquote>Does seeing a psychologist mean that you are mental?</blockquote>

    <p>
    Most people think that psychologists only see people with mental health
    problems. But most children and adolescents who see psychologists do not have a
    diagnosis of a mental illness. Most are just going through a difficult time,
    maybe due to their parents divorcing or being bullied at school. Or their self
    esteem may be low, they may feel worried or angry about things. All people
    experience difficult situations and emotions in their lives, but if they have
    been going on for a while, it can be useful to see a psychologist to help you
    get out of the situation.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <blockquote>Can psychologists read thoughts?</blockquote>

    <p>
    No, psychologists can't read thoughts but we are good at working out how
    problems have started and what people do to maintain the problem.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <blockquote>How can talking about my problems help?</blockquote>

    <p>
    Some people say that just talking about your problem with someone who can take
    a more objective view of the situation helps them think differently about their
    problem. Other people want a bit more help and that is why psychologists are
    trained in different therapies that have different ways of addressing problems.
    And although we may not be able to change what is going on for you (for
    example, parents divorcing or having a chronic illness), we can help making the
    experience less stressful and help you get on with your life and achieve your
    goals in other areas.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <blockquote>Will you tell my parents what we talk about?</blockquote>

    <p>
    Psychological therapy is confidential. This means that unless agreed, I will
    not tell your parents what you have told me. However, it is often useful for
    parents to know a bit about what we discuss to ensure that everyone in the
    family does what they can to help changing the situation. It is up to you what
    you want to tell your parents and if you are not comfortable telling them
    outside the therapy, we can do it together. There is also one exception to
    confidentiality, which is if you would tell me something that means that you or
    someone else is at risk. For example, you may have thoughts of harming
    yourself, or an adult may have done something that is regarded as abuse. In
    these kinds of situations, I need to ensure that you are not harmed by telling
    the people who can keep you safe.
