<h1>Information for children and teenagers</h1>
<p>
Have you ever met a psychologist before? Most people haven't when they come and
see me the first time and they have all different ideas of what it is going to
be like.  Some people may feel worried about coming and are angry with their
parents for making them come. Here are some common worries that people have
told me in the past:
</p>
<h2>What does a psychologist do the first time you meet?</h2>
<p>
The first time we meet, I will ask a lot of questions in order to understand
what is going on for you and so that we can make a plan of how I can help. I
will ask what the problem is, when it started and how it started and how it is
impacting on your life. I will also ask questions about your school and family.
I will also ask what your goals are. For example, if you are not a very
confident person, one goal may be to go to a party on your own. If you have a
phobia of cats, your goal may be to visit a friend who has a cat. We will then
come up with what we call a 'formulation' (which is a way of explaining how the
problem came about and why it is still there) and the formulation will help us
decide what we need to do to tackle the problem and achieve the goals. I may
also suggest some things that you can try out at home that could help you.

<h2>Does seeing a psychologist mean that you are mental?</h2>
<p>
Most people think that psychologists only see people with mental health
problems.  But actually, most children and adolescents who see psychologists do
not have a diagnosis of a mental health problem. Most are just going through a
difficult time, for example because their parents are divorcing, they are being
bullyied at school, their self esteem is low or they feel worried or angry
about things. Most people have these experiences at some point, but if they
have been going on for a while, they can become quite difficult to get out of,
because a lot of the actions we do and the thoughts we have is actually making
the problem worse. This does not mean you are mental &mdash; it just means you are
human.
</p>
<h2>Can psychologists read thoughts?</h2>
<p>
No, psychologists can't read thoughts but we are good at working out how
problems have started and how what we do and how we think means that the
problem is maintained. And then we have lots of strategies and suggestions
(often proven by research evidence) that can help breaking vicious cycles
people are stuck in.
</p>
<h2>How can talking about my problems help?</h2>
<p>
Some people say that just talking about your problem helps them think
differently about their problem. Other people want a bit more help and that is
why psychologists are trained in different therapies that have different ways
of tackling problems.  And although we often can't change what is going on for
you (for example, parents divorcing or having a chronic illness), we can help
making the experience less stressful and help you get on with your life and
achieve your goals in other areas.

<h2>Does a psychologist just sit there without saying anything?</h2>
