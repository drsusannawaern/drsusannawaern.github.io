<h2>Psychological assessment</h2>
<p>
A psychological assessment looks at how a problem developed, what maintains it
and helps inform how the problem will be resolved. Psychologists are generally
less concerned with diagnosis and instead specialises in finding an individual
so called formulation for every person. This formulation then helps tailor the
intervention.
</p>
<h2>Neuropsychological/cognitive assessment</h2>
<p>
A neuropsychological assessment is tailored to address a specific problem that
impacts on an individual's academic progress, for example problems with memory
or with planning and organising work. An assessment looks at a child's
cognitive strengths and weaknesses and considers how a child strengths can be
used to lessen the impact of any weakness. The assessment report contains
recommendations for the family and for school.
</p>
<p>
A cognitive assessment is an assessment of general intellectual functioning
(IQ) and looks at four different domains â€“ verbal comprehension, perceptual
reasoning (non- verbal problem solving), working memory (manipulating
information whilst holding it in mind) and processing speed (processing
information and responding to it using a simple motor task). A full scale IQ
score cannot always be given if there is a lot of discrepancy between the
different areas assessed, however, if this is a case, the report will discuss
this discrepancy and report the results from each individual area.

<h2>Psychological therapy</h2>
<p>
Many children and young people go through emotional difficulties when they grow
up. Going through ups and downs is normal and can often be resolved with the
help and support of families and friends. However, sometimes people can get
stuck in negative cycles which are difficult to break. This is when
psychological therapy can be helpful. Common problems in childhood and
adolescence include low mood, anxiety, behaviour problems, low self-esteem and
post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Susanna offers a range of therapies,
including Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
(ACT), Narrative Therapy, Solution Focused Therapy and Family Therapy (Systemic
Therapy). She offers individualised therapy, taking the developmental stage of
the child or young person into account.  Adapted forms of these therapies are
offered to younger children and children/young people with cognitive
difficulties.
</p>
<h2>Paediatrics</h2>
<p>
Children with serious or chronic illness are at increased risk of psychological
problems. Psychological therapy can be helpful in terms of addressing a range
of different issues related to having a physical health condition, such as
accepting a diagnosis, adherence to medical treatment, self-esteem issues
related to physical health problems and pain management.
</p>
<h2>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT)</h2>
<p>
CBT is a goal focused, problem solving therapy and looks at how our thoughts
and behaviours impacts on our mood. Cycles of thoughts, feelings and behaviours
are identified and the therapy consists of breaking these negative cycles by
changing behaviours and challenging thoughts. CBT has been found helpful for
problems such as low mood, anxiety (including phobias), low self-esteem and
PTSD.
</p>
<h2>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</h2>
<p>
ACT is a form of cognitive therapy but it's main focus is getting on with life
despite difficulties. ACT has a good evidence base for pain management. One
area of ACT is to develop Mindfulness, a concept that is becoming increasingly
influential in today's society.
