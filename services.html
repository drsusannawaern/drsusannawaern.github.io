<h1>Services offered</h1>

<h2 id="paediatrics">Paediatrics</h2>

<p>
Children with chronic illness and physical health problems are at increased
risk of emotional and behavioural difficulties. This is particularly true for
children with conditions that affect the brain. Psychological therapy can
address a range of different issues related to living with a physical health
condition, such as accepting a diagnosis, adherence to medical treatment,
self-esteem issues and pain management. It can also improve quality of life by
minimising secondary problems related to the illness and by focusing on
achieving goals and values of the young person. 
</p>

<p>
Having a child with a chronic illness affects the whole family. It can be
difficult as a parent to maintain the rules and boundaries you would normally
have at home and this can lead to behavioural problems and conflict.
Relationships between siblings can also become strained, with any siblings who
are not unwell feeling left out and sidelined. As a result, Susanna offers
parenting work and therapy with siblings. 
</p>

<p>
Susanna has extensive experience of working with children and young adults with
a range of different medical conditions, including cancer, diabetes, epilepsy,
brain injuries, cerebral palsy, sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis. She
has also worked for many years with siblings and parents of children with
chronic illness.

<h3>Neuropsychological assessment</h3>

<p>
A neuropsychological assessment is concerned with brain functions that affect
learning and academic progress. Neuropsychological assessments are particularly
important for children who have suffered from an acquired brain injury, such as
a brain tumour, stroke or a brain injury following an accident, or who have a
medical condition that affects the brain, for example, epilepsy. However,
children without an obvious brain injury can also struggle in school and a
neuropsychological assessment can establish whether this is due to a problem
with the function of the brain, or whether it is due to psychosocial factors
such as anxiety, pain or 
</p>

<p>
A neuropsychological assessment can focus on a range of different functions of
the brain, such as memory, planning and organising work, and attention,
depending on the problem experienced. An assessment establishes a child’s
strengths and weaknesses and the assessment report contains recommendations for
the family and for school. Sometimes the words “cognitive assessments” and
“neuropsychological assessments” are used interchangeably. A cognitive
assessment is an assessment of general intellectual functioning (IQ) and is an
important part of a neuropsychological assessment.
</p>

<h3>Neuropsychological intervention</h3>

<p>
Neuropsychological interventions can be targeted at different areas and include
consultations to schools in order to inform them about the child’s functioning
and provide recommendations that can help the child’s academic progress. It can
also include education for the family about the strengths and weakness of the
child, specific parenting skills for children with an acquired brain injury,
teaching the child strategies that can help academic progress, and discussion
about external tools and devices that can support the child’s learning.
</p>

<h2 id="assessments">Assessments</h2>

<p>
A psychological assessment focuses on understanding how a problem developed,
what maintains it and helps inform a plan of how to deal with the problem.
Whilst an assessment can be diagnostic (for example, diagnosing depression),
Psychologists are generally less concerned with diagnosis and instead
specialises in finding an individual explanation for every person. This means
that an individual treatment plan can be developed and the problem can still be
addressed even if it does not fit the criteria for a specific diagnosis.
</p>

<h2 id="therapies">Therapies</h2>

<p>
Psychological therapies can be helpful for a range of different emotional and
behavioural problems. Common problems include anxiety, phobias, low mood, Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), low self-esteem, anger, self-harm and
bereavement.
</p>

<p>
Psychological therapy can also address a range of different issues related to
living with a physical health condition, such as accepting a diagnosis,
adherence to medical treatment, and pain management. Therapy will be adapted
according to the child age and level of cognitive function. The decision which
therapy to use is made based on the presenting problem, the evidence base and
the preferences of the family.
</p>

<h3>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT)</h3>

<p>
CBT looks at how your thoughts and behaviours influence the way you feel. By
changing the way you think and how you act in certain situations, it can
influence the way you feel. CBT focuses primarily on problems and difficulties
in the here and now, although it will take into account events that have led to
the current difficulties.
</p>

<p>
CBT has been thoroughly researched and is a recommended psychological treatment
for a range of different problems, including anxiety and low mood.
</p>

<h3>Family Therapy (Systemic Therapy)</h3>

<p>
Family therapy seeks to understand problems in a contextual framework rather
than addressing the problem on an individual level. Working with children and
young people, Family Therapy strategies are often incorporated into other
therapies (like CBT), recognising the fact that when a family member has a
problem, this will affect the rest of the family, and their actions will in
turn influence the problem.
</p>

<h3>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</h3>

<p>
ACT is a form of cognitive therapy which focuses on accepting what is out of
your personal control and committing to taking action that enriches your life.
ACT emphasises the importance of living mindfully (see below for more
information about Mindfulness).
</p>

<p>
ACT has an increasing evidence base for dealing with psychological problems, in
particular in the area of chronic pain.
</p>

<h3>Mindfulness</h3>

<p>
Mindfulness is not a therapy per se but has recently been incorporated as a
skill to use as part of CBT or ACT. Mindfulness means paying attention in a
particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally. It
can change the way you relate to a problem and reduce the impact of negative
experiences, thoughts and feelings.
</p>

<h3>Bereavement</h3>

<p>
There is no such thing as a ‘normal’ bereavement and most children or young
people who go through a bereavement do not need professional input. However, if
the child has strong reactions that continue over time (including drastic
behaviour changes), school performance is seriously affected, and the child or
young people isolate themselves from family and friends, bereavement therapy
can be of benefit.  In cases where the child is bereaved by suicide or murder,
the child has witnessed the death, or the child had responsibility for the
death or responsibility for the dead person, early professional contact is
recommended.
</p>

<h2 id="parenting">Parenting</h2>

<p>
Being a parent can be very stressful and especially if your child has a
physical illness or special needs. Parenting sessions focus on understanding
the meaning of your child’s behaviour and finding strategies that can improve
difficult behaviour. It focuses on building a relationship between a child and
a parent that focuses on positive interactions.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the age of your child, your child may have their own therapy in
conjunction with parenting sessions and some sessions may be done jointly.
</p>

<h2 id="consultation-and-teaching">Consultation and Teaching</h2>

<p>
Consultation and teaching covering a range of topics is offered to NHS
services, schools, universities and private organisations.
</p>

<h3>Consultation</h3>

<p>
Consultation regarding neuropsychological issues is offered to NHS services and
schools where there is no access to a paediatric neuropsychologist, or where
specialist knowledge about a certain condition is required. 
</p>

<p>
The level of consultation can vary depending on the need of the service but can
involve anything from a telephone conversation discussing test results to
helping to plan an assessment.
<p>

<h3>Teaching</h3>

<p>
Teaching covering a range of topics can be offered, including paediatric
psychology, paediatric neuropsychology, child development, emotional and
behavioural problems in childhood, therapies for children and stress
