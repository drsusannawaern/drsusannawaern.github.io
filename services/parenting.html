<h1>Parenting</h1>

<p>
Being a parent can be very stressful and especially if your child has a
physical illness or special needs. Parenting sessions focus on understanding
the meaning of your child's behaviour and finding strategies that can improve
difficult behaviour. It focuses on building a relationship between a child and
a parent that focuses on positive interactions.

<p>
Depending on the age of your child, your child may have their own therapy in
conjunction with parenting sessions and some sessions may be done jointly.
