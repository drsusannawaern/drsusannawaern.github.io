<h1>Parenting</h1>

<p>
Being a parent can be very stressful, especially if your child has a physical
illness or special needs. Parenting sessions focus on understanding the meaning
of your child's behaviour, what may influence it, and on finding strategies
that can improve difficult behaviour. It focuses on empowering the parents and
building a relationship between a child and a parent that is based on positive
interactions.

<p>
Depending on the age of your child, your child may have their own therapy in
conjunction with parenting sessions and some sessions may be done jointly.

Susanna has extensive experience of working with parents and understands the
dilemmas parents may come across when trying to challenge their childrenâ€™s
behaviour. Her approach is based on behavioural principles and well-researched
strategies, and she also acknowledges that when the parent lacks confidence in
their parenting, these strategies are less likely to succeed.
