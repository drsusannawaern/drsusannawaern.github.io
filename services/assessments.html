<h1>Assessments</h1>

<p>
A psychological assessment focuses on understanding how a problem developed,
what maintains it and helps inform a plan of how to deal with the problem.
Whilst an assessment can be diagnostic (for example, diagnosing depression),
Psychologists are generally less concerned with diagnosis and instead
specialises in finding an individual explanation for every person. This means
that an individual treatment plan can be developed and the problem can still be
addressed even if it does not fit the criteria for a specific diagnosis.
