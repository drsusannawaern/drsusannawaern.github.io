<h1>Assessments</h1>

<p>
A psychological assessment focuses on understanding how a problem developed,
what maintains it. It also looks at any exceptions to the problem and what
children and parents have tried in order to deal with the problem. This
information contributes to a plan (a so called formulation) of how to deal with
the problem (the intervention, or therapy).  Whilst an assessment can be
diagnostic (for example, diagnosing depression), Psychologists are generally
less concerned with diagnosis and instead specialises in finding an individual
formulation for every person. This means that an individual treatment plan can
be developed and a problem can still be addressed even if it does not fit the
criteria for a specific diagnosis. Any psychological intervention will start
with an assessment, although the duration of the assessment will vary depending
on the complexity and the duration of the problem.

NHS as well as in the private sector.
