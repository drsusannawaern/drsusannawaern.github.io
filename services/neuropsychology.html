<h1>Neuropsychology</h1>

<h2>Neuropsychological assessment</h2>

<p>
A neuropsychological assessment is concerned with brain functions that affect
learning and academic progress. Neuropsychological assessments are particularly
important for children who have suffered from an acquired brain injury, such as
a brain tumour, stroke or a brain injury following an accident, or who have a
medical condition that affects the brain, for example, epilepsy. However,
children without an obvious brain injury can also struggle in school and a
neuropsychological assessment can establish whether this is due to a problem
with the function of the brain, or whether it is due to psychosocial factors
such as anxiety, pain or
</p>

<p>
A neuropsychological assessment can focus on a range of different functions of
the brain, such as memory, planning and organising work, and attention,
depending on the problem experienced. An assessment establishes a child's
strengths and weaknesses and the assessment report contains recommendations for
the family and for school. Sometimes the words "cognitive assessments" and
"neuropsychological assessments" are used interchangeably. A cognitive
assessment is an assessment of general intellectual functioning (IQ) and is an
important part of a neuropsychological assessment.

<h2>Neuropsychological intervention</h2>

<p>
Neuropsychological interventions can be targeted at different areas and include
consultations to schools in order to inform them about the child's functioning
and provide recommendations that can help the child's academic progress. It can
also include education for the family about the strengths and weakness of the
child, specific parenting skills for children with an acquired brain injury,
teaching the child strategies that can help academic progress, and discussion
about external tools and devices that can support the child's learning.
