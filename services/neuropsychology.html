<h1>Neuropsychology</h1>

<h2>Neuropsychological assessment</h2>

<p>
A neuropsychological assessment can focus on a range of different functions of
the brain that can affect learning and academic progress, as well as every day
living skills. This includes areas such as memory, planning and organising
work, speed of processing and attention. An assessment establishes a child’s
strengths and weaknesses and the assessment report contains recommendations for
the family and for school. Sometimes the words “cognitive assessments” and
“neuropsychological assessments” are used interchangeably. A cognitive
assessment is an assessment of general intellectual functioning (or IQ), which
includes verbal and perceptual skills, and is an important part of a
neuropsychological assessment.
</p>

<p>
Neuropsychological assessments are particularly important for children who have
suffered from injuries and illnesses that affect the brain, such as a brain
tumour, stroke, cerebral palsy, brain injury following an accidenta and
epilepsy. However, children without brain injury can also struggle in school
and a neuropsychological assessment can help establishing whether the child has
any underlying cognitive difficulties that affect their academic progress.

<h2>Neuropsychological intervention</h2>

<p>
Neuropsychological interventions can be targeted at different areas and include
consultations to schools in order to inform them about the child's functioning
and provide recommendations that can help the child's academic progress. It can
also include education for the family about the strengths and weakness of the
child, specific parenting skills for children with an acquired brain injury,
teaching the child strategies that can help academic progress, and discussion
about external tools and devices that can support the child's learning. How the
family function together is also known to be an important factor in how well a
child manages after a brain injury, and as a result, family interventions are
also offered.

Susanna has completed post-doctoral training in neuropsychology and has many
years experience of working with children with neuropsychological issues, both
in terms of assessments as well as providing long-term interventions and
support for the whole family. Her experience includes working with children
with brain tumours, stroke, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and traumatic brain
injuries (for example, following road traffic accidents).
