<h1>Paediatrics</h1>

<p>
Children with chronic illness and physical health problems are at increased
risk of emotional and behavioural difficulties. This is particularly true for
children with conditions that affect the brain. Psychological therapy can
address a range of different issues related to living with a physical health
condition, such as accepting a diagnosis, adherence to medical treatment,
self-esteem issues and pain management. It can also improve quality of life by
minimising secondary problems related to the illness and by focusing on
achieving goals and values of the young person.
</p>

<p>
Having a child with a chronic illness affects the whole family. It can be
difficult as a parent to maintain the rules and boundaries you would normally
have at home and this can lead to behavioural problems and conflict.
Relationships between siblings can also become strained, with any siblings who
are not unwell feeling left out and sidelined. As a result, Susanna offers
parenting work and therapy with siblings.

Susanna has extensive experience of working with children and young adults with
a range of different medical conditions, including cancer, diabetes, epilepsy,
brain injuries, cerebral palsy, sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis. She
has also worked for many years with siblings and parents of children with
chronic illness.
