<h1>Therapies</h1>

<p>
Psychological therapies can be helpful for a range of different emotional and
behavioural problems. Common problems include anxiety, phobias, low mood, Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), low self-esteem, anger, self-harm and
bereavement.
</p>

<p>
Psychological therapy can also address a range of different issues related to
living with a physical health condition, such as accepting a diagnosis,
adherence to medical treatment, and pain management. Therapy will be adapted
according to the child age and level of cognitive function. The decision which
therapy to use is made based on the presenting problem, the evidence base and
the preferences of the family.
</p>

<h2>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT)</h2>

<p>
CBT looks at how your thoughts and behaviours influence the way you feel. By
changing the way you think and how you act in certain situations, it can
influence the way you feel. CBT focuses primarily on problems and difficulties
in the here and now, although it will take into account events that have led to
the current difficulties.
</p>

<p>
CBT has been thoroughly researched and is a recommended psychological treatment
for a range of different problems, including anxiety and low mood.
</p>

<h2>Family Therapy (Systemic Therapy)</h2>

<p>
Family therapy seeks to understand problems in a contextual framework rather
than addressing the problem on an individual level. Working with children and
young people, Family Therapy strategies are often incorporated into other
therapies (like CBT), recognising the fact that when a family member has a
problem, this will affect the rest of the family, and their actions will in
turn influence the problem.
</p>

<h2>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</h2>

<p>
ACT is a form of cognitive therapy which focuses on accepting what is out of
your personal control and committing to taking action that enriches your life.
ACT emphasises the importance of living mindfully (see below for more
information about Mindfulness).
</p>

<p>
ACT has an increasing evidence base for dealing with psychological problems, in
particular in the area of chronic pain.
</p>

<h2>Mindfulness</h2>

<p>
Mindfulness is not a therapy per se but has recently been incorporated as a
skill to use as part of CBT or ACT. Mindfulness means paying attention in a
particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally. It
can change the way you relate to a problem and reduce the impact of negative
experiences, thoughts and feelings.
</p>

<h2>Bereavement</h2>

<p>
There is no such thing as a 'normal' bereavement and most children or young
people who go through a bereavement do not need professional input. However, if
the child has strong reactions that continue over time (including drastic
behaviour changes), school performance is seriously affected, and the child or
young people isolate themselves from family and friends, bereavement therapy
can be of benefit.  In cases where the child is bereaved by suicide or murder,
the child has witnessed the death, or the child had responsibility for the
death or responsibility for the dead person, early professional contact is
recommended.
