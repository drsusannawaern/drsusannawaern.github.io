<h1>Therapies</h1>

<p>
Psychological therapies can be helpful for a range of different emotional and
behavioural problems. Common psychological problems include anxiety, phobias,
low mood, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), low self-esteem, anger,
self-harm and bereavement.
</p>

<p>
Psychological therapy can also address a range of different issues related to
living with a physical health condition, such as accepting a diagnosis,
adherence to medical treatment, and pain management. Therapy will be adapted
according to the child age and level of cognitive function. The decision which
therapy to use is made based on the presenting problem, the evidence base for a
particular therapy for a particular problem and the preferences of the family.
</p>

<h2>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT)</h2>

<p>
CBT looks at how your thoughts and behaviours influence the way you feel. By
changing the way you think and how you act in certain situations, it can
influence the way you feel. CBT focuses primarily on problems and difficulties
in the here and now, although it will take into account past events that have led to
the current difficulties.
</p>

<p>
CBT has been thoroughly researched and is a recommended psychological treatment
for a range of different problems, including anxiety and low mood.
</p>

<h2>Family Therapy (Systemic Therapy)</h2>

<p>
Family therapy seeks to understand problems in a contextual framework rather
than addressing the problem on an individual level. Working with children and
young people, Family Therapy strategies are often incorporated into other
therapies (like CBT), recognising the fact that when a family member has a
problem, this will affect the rest of the family, and their actions will in
turn influence the problem.
</p>

<h2>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</h2>

<p>
ACT is a form of cognitive therapy which instead of challenging negative
thoughts (as in traditional CBT) focuses on accepting that difficult feelings
and thoughts will be part of peoples’ lives. By learning to stop struggling
with these thoughts and feelings, they will become less influential and frees
people up to focus on their values in life and on taking positive action
despite their difficulties. ACT also emphasises the importance of living
mindfully (see below for more information about Mindfulness).
</p>

<p>
ACT has an increasing evidence base for dealing with psychological problems, in
particular in the area of chronic pain.
</p>

<h2>Mindfulness</h2>

<p>
Mindfulness is not a therapy per se but has recently been incorporated as a
skill to use as part of CBT or ACT. Mindfulness means paying attention in a
particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally. It
can change the way you relate to a problem and reduce the impact of negative
experiences, thoughts and feelings.
</p>

<h2>Bereavement</h2>

<p>
Most children and young people who go through a bereavement do not need
professional input. There is no such thing as a ‘normal’ bereavement and
children will react differently to a loss. However, if the child has strong
reactions that continue over time (including drastic behaviour changes), school
performance is seriously affected, and the child or young people isolate
themselves from family and friends, bereavement therapy can be of benefit. In
cases where the child is bereaved by suicide or murder, the child has witnessed
the death, or the child had responsibility for the death or responsibility for
the dead person, early professional contact is recommended.
</p>

<p>
Susanna has substantial training and experience in CBT and of adapting this to
the child’s age or cognitive function. She has successfully used CBT approaches
with children presenting with a range of different emotional and behavioural
difficulties, including low self esteem, anxiety, low mood and anger. She has
developed her practice in line with new evidence bases and as such incorporates
Mindfulness and ACT into her work. Since a child is inevitably affected by the
context in which they are living, Susanna will always incorporate systemic
therapy elements into her interventions. Her current work with children with
cancer means that she regularly meets bereaved children and adults.
